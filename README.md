# Salary Prediction - Machine Learning Web App

Welcome! This repository contains a simple **Salary Prediction** web application built using **Python**, **Machine Learning**, and **Streamlit**.

## üîç About the Project

This project demonstrates how machine learning models can be integrated into interactive web apps. Using a real-world dataset, I trained a machine learning model to predict salaries based on inputs. The app allows users to interact with the model using a friendly interface.
